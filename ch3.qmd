## Problems

1.  (Coin Flipping Doors) Monty will try out a new version of his Monty Hall game. He will begin with exactly one door. Monty will flip a coin, and if it lands on heads, Monty will hide a goat behind the door, and if it hands on tails, Monty will hide a car behind that door. If a goat was hidden, then Monty will add another door to the right of the original door and flip the coin again. Monty will continue this process of adding doors to the right until the car has been hidden.

    Afterwards, Monty will flip his coin again. If it lands on heads, the entire process stops. If it lands on tails, Monty adds another door to the right and flips the coin again. This process continues until the coin lands on heads.

    After Monty is done adding doors, he will play a Monty Hall game where the contestant initially picks a door, Monty reveals \emph{one} of the remaining doors that contains a goat (randomly choosing between goat-containing doors with equal probabilities if he has a choice), and the contestant is allowed to make their final choice.

    The contestant walks into the Monty Hall game, and there are three doors. The contestant initially picks door 1, and Monty reveals a goat behind door 2. What is the probability that the car is behind door 3?

    ## Solution

    Let $D$ be the number of doors generated by Monty, and let $C$ be the r.v. denoting the door the car is behind. We know $C - 1 \sim \Geom(1/2)$ and $D - C \sim \Geom(1/2).$ Let $M_i$ denote the event of Monty revealing a goat behind door $i.$ We wish to find $P(C=3|M_2,D=3).$ By Bayes' Rule, we get
    $$
    P(C=3|M_2,D=3) = \frac{P(M_2|C=3,D=3)P(D=3|C=3)P(C=3)}{P(M_2,D=3)}.
    $$
    Clearly, $P(M_2|C=3,D=3) = 1.$ We have $P(D=3|C=3) = 1/2$ as it is the probability that the coin Monty flipped after deciding where the car is landed on heads. We have $P(C=3) = P(C-1=2) = 1/8$ using the $\Geom(1/2)$ PMF.
    \par Now, finding $P(M_2,D=3),$ we note that by LOTP, this is
    $$
    P(M_2|C=3,D=3)P(D=3|C=3)P(C=3)+P(M_2|C=1,D=3)P(D=3|C=1)P(C=1).
    $$
    We already calculated the first half of the sum. To find the second half, we find $P(M_2|C=1,D=3) = 1/2,$ $P(D=3|C=1) = 1/8,$ and $P(C=1) = 1/2.$ Plugging everything in, we get
    $$
    P(C=3|M_2,D=3) = \frac{(1)(1/2)(1/8)}{(1)(1/2)(1/8)+(1/2)(1/8)(1/2)} = \frac{2}{3}.
    $$
    This is the same answer as in the original Monty Hall problem! One way to intuitively see this is that from the beginning, the probability of the car being behind door 1 is equal to the probability of the car being behind door 3 by symmetry because we are given $(C-1) + (D-C),$ both of which are independent $\Geom(1/2)$ r.v.s and hence by symmetry are equally likely to be 0 and 2, 1 and 1, or 2 and 2. Note that this did not depend on the $1/2$ value; hence, even if the coin was a biased coin that landed on heads with probability $p,$ the probability that the car is behind door 3 would still be $2/3.$ Moreover, once again by symmetry, even if Monty had revealed a goat behind door 3 instead, the probability that the car is behind door 2 would still be $2/3.$
